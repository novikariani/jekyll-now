In celebrating World Food Day 2017 on October 16, Danone Group in Indonesia held Food for Better Days program to invite young generation to love and optimize the local food potency to build Indonesian Food Security. Through this program, Indonesia’s Danone Group encourages young people to grow local food sources in their homes. This activity in line with the theme of Food Day 2017 "Moving Young Generation in Developing Agriculture Towards Indonesia World Food Barns". <br />

The Food for Better Days event held at SOS Children's Villages Indonesia, as partnering between Indonesia’s Danone Group and SOS Children's Villages Indonesia. This is an international non-governmental / national non-governmental social organization to support the rights of children and is committed to providing children who have or are in danger of losing parental care. <br />

The employees come to cook and serve lunch with local food such as corn, sweet potato, and cassava for children at SOS Children's Villages Indonesia. Previously, these volunteer employees also donated healthy foods such as milk, biscuits, green beans, groceries and others. To raised enthusiasm of children and mothers, food processing practices are also featured with cooking demonstrations from Chef Rama who do have the skills to process local food. Not only knowledge about local food, volunteers also provide education about balanced nutrition and healthy hydration to children through fairy tales. <br />

I was volunteer in planting activity, who are guided by “Komunitas Indonesia Berkebun” also teach young generation how to grow local food such as fruits and vegetables in the yard of their homes. This activity is aiming to optimization of yard land by producing food needs by the family and the momentum in raising awareness of healthier food patterns
