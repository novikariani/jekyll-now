Another travel, art is one of beautiful travel in my life.
One of the amazing characteristics of Balinese dance is its perfusion throughout the culture. Children as young as four years old are taught the beginning moves, and it is not uncommon to see eighty year old women gracefully moving to the sounds of the gamelan orchestra.

They area two different baliness dance function. First, Baliness dance for the dance is based out of an offering to the Gods, a prayer of sorts. Second, Baliness dance for entertain. Those two have difference meaning too. I am the one that just learn how to dance in very late age, as I mention before people/children as young age are taught how to dance, except me. 

Since young age I love many things, but never try dance because I was not really interest or might be at that time I was drive to  another environment which is not dance. Time flies, in senior high school, I had to receive a point from subject of dance or doing gamelan. I begin to try gamelan in one week, unfortunately its was not work at all. Then I moved to dance which means I had a couple more weeks to learn. It was very tough because I never know the basic of dance. My hand, my body, my bones, and my leg was very stiff so that makes me easy to get hurt. Good news, I am kind of fast learner at that time, thus it is make me easy to remmember some moves. 

Start from that time, I really enjoyed to dance. Until now... I still love it.
