and I'm Exited!
The more I meet people, the more I want to meet them. Simple, I do love traveling because I can meet more people. I'am originally from Bali, born in Bali, almost 17 years I spend my time in Bali. No wonder,for me, Bali is best place for living because of its cultures, its food, its places, and its people. People drives me to understand about many things. Meanwhile, experiences teach me the right thing to learn from mistakes.
<br/>
Time passed, I realize that exploring Bali is not enough for me in order to meet diversity of people. Since 2014, I has been taking my study far from home. Jakarta. The central city of Indonesia. Here, I learn many things about people and its definition. Besides, traveling still becomes my favorite so I am usually spend a spare a time to hangout with friends. Instead of that, I am interest in art such as theatrical art, painting, dancing, etc. These experiences will be tribute on the next post! 

Stay tune!
